Description:

    Generates a layout file with some handy utilities:

     - Bootstrap (or a Bootswatch)
     - Font Awesome
     - A navbar with
        - links to all detected index pages
        - links to all detected registration and sign in forms
     - Components to display flash notices and alerts
     - A sticky footer

    Specify "none" as the THEME_NAME to use vanilla Bootstrap; or, choose a
    Bootswatch. As of this writing, available Bootswatches are:

      - cerulean
      - cosmo
      - cyborg
      - darkly
      - flatly
      - journal
      - lumen
      - none
      - paper
      - readable
      - sandstone
      - simplex
      - slate
      - spacelab
      - superhero
      - united
      - yeti

    WARNING: You will lose any modifications you've made to your current layout
    if you choose to overwrite it. You can also specify a different filename
    other than "application" with the --layout-file option.

    Examples:

        rails generate draft:layout

        rails generate draft:layout --theme=paper

        rails generate draft:layout --layout-file=some_other_filename

        rails generate draft:layout --skip-cdn

    (The last one omits links to CDN-hosted Bootstrap CSS, JS, and Font Awesome,
    in case you are e.g. bundling them yourself using gems.)
